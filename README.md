## Contribution Guidelines
* Never push to directly main. Use branches.
* Always work on your own branch. If you want to contribute to someone elses branch, fork it and submit a PR. This helps prevent constant merge conflicts.
* Adhere to `<component>: <change>` commit naming. If a commit changes multiple components, name it after their common parrent.
* Be atomic with commits. It reduces merge conflicts and makes progress easier to track.
